# Automatic — Using the MCP Service

Automatic is a desktop application that acts as a **skill registry, memory store, and MCP configuration hub** for AI agent tooling. It does not run agents itself. Instead, it serves data to agents on request via an MCP server interface.

## When to Use Automatic

Use the Automatic MCP tools when you need to:

- Discover which skills are available in the user's skill registry
- Load a skill's instructions and discover its companion resources
- Search the community skills.sh registry for relevant skills
- Find MCP server configurations to suggest or apply
- Inspect or list the user's registered projects
- Check which Claude Code sessions are currently active
- Sync a project's configurations to its directory
- **Store, retrieve, or search long-term memory across sessions for a specific project**

## Available MCP Tools

Automatic exposes the following tools via the `nexus` MCP server (configured as `nexus mcp-serve`):

### `automatic_list_skills`

List all skill names currently registered in the user's skill registry (`~/.automatic/library/skills/`, with `~/.agents/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` scanned read-only).

**When to use:** At the start of a session or task to discover what specialised instructions are available. If you find a relevant skill, read it with `automatic_read_skill`.

---

### `automatic_read_skill`

Read the full `SKILL.md` content of a specific skill. This also automatically discovers and returns a list of any companion resources (scripts, templates, examples, etc.) bundled in the skill directory.

```
name: string  — the skill directory name, e.g. "laravel-specialist"
```

**When to use:** After identifying a relevant skill via `automatic_list_skills`. Load and follow the skill's instructions for the current task.

---

### `automatic_search_skills`

Search the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) community registry for skills matching a query. Returns skill names, install counts, and source repos.

```
query: string  — skill name, topic, or keyword, e.g. "react", "laravel", "docker"
```

**When to use:** When you or the user want to discover community-published skills that are not yet installed locally. Follow up by fetching the skill content and suggesting installation via Automatic.

---

### `automatic_list_mcp_servers`

Return all MCP server configurations stored in the Automatic registry (`~/.automatic/mcp_servers/`).

**When to use:** When the user asks about available MCP servers, or when you need to reference server configs before syncing a project.

---

### `automatic_list_projects`

List all project names registered in Automatic.

**When to use:** When you need to find out which projects the user has configured, before reading a specific project or syncing it.

---

### `automatic_read_project`

Read the full configuration for a named project: description, directory path, assigned skills, MCP servers, providers, and configured agent tools.

```
name: string  — the project name as registered in Automatic
```

**When to use:** When you need to understand a project's configured context (e.g. which skills and MCP servers apply, or where the project directory is) before performing work in it.

---

### `automatic_get_project_context`

Read the structured context for a named project from `.automatic/context.json` in the project directory. Returns all sections in a single call:

- **commands** — build, test, lint, and other runnable commands
- **entry_points** — key source files or modules to orient around
- **concepts** — named architectural concepts with summaries and relevant file paths
- **conventions** — coding and naming conventions to follow
- **gotchas** — known pitfalls and environment-specific warnings
- **docs** — indexed documentation files with summaries and paths

```
project: string  — the project name as registered in Automatic
```

**When to use:** At the start of a session or before making changes to a project. The context tells you the correct build commands, where to start reading, how the codebase is organised, and what to watch out for. Prefer this over guessing from directory structure alone.

Returns an empty context object (no error) if the file has not been created yet.

---

### `automatic_sync_project`

Sync a project's MCP server configs and skill references to its directory for all configured agent tools (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, etc.).

```
name: string  — the project name as registered in Automatic
```

**When to use:** After the user updates a project's configuration (skills, MCP servers, agents) in Automatic and wants the changes written to the project directory.

---

### `automatic_list_sessions`

List active Claude Code sessions tracked by the Nexus hooks. Each entry includes session id, working directory (`cwd`), model, and `started_at` timestamp.

**When to use:** When you want to know what other Claude Code sessions are currently active — useful for awareness of parallel work or cross-session context.

---

### Agent Memory Tools

Automatic provides a persistent key-value store for agents to retain context, user preferences, and learnings over time on a per-project basis.

- **`automatic_store_memory`**: Stores a memory entry. Takes `project`, `key`, `value`, and optional `source`.
- **`automatic_get_memory`**: Retrieves a specific memory entry by its `project` and `key`.
- **`automatic_list_memories`**: Lists all stored memory keys for a `project`, optionally filtered by a `pattern`.
- **`automatic_search_memories`**: Searches both keys and values for a `query` string within a `project`.
- **`automatic_delete_memory`**: Deletes a specific memory entry by `project` and `key`.
- **`automatic_clear_memories`**: Clears all memories for a `project` (requires `confirm: true` and optional `pattern`).

**When to use:** Proactively store memory when you learn a significant project-specific rule, a user preference, or architectural decision that you (or other agents) will need in future sessions. Search memories at the start of complex tasks to see if previous guidance applies.

---

### Agent Feature Tools

Automatic provides project-scoped feature tracking. Features represent discrete units of work with a lifecycle visible to users in the Automatic UI.

**States:** `backlog` → `todo` → `in_progress` → `review` → `complete` · `cancelled`  
**Priority:** `low` | `medium` | `high`  
**Effort:** `xs` | `s` | `m` | `l` | `xl`

- **`automatic_list_features`**: List active (non-archived) features for a project. Optionally pass `state` to filter (e.g. `"todo"`). Pass `include_archived: true` to list archived features instead. Returns feature titles, IDs, priorities, efforts, and assignees grouped by state.
- **`automatic_get_feature`**: Get full detail for a specific feature by `feature_id`, including description, archived status, and all update history. Works for both active and archived features.
- **`automatic_create_feature`**: Create a new feature in the backlog. Requires `project` and `title`. Optional: `description`, `priority`, `assignee`, `tags`, `linked_files`, `effort`, `created_by`. Returns the created feature including its `id`.
- **`automatic_update_feature`**: Update feature metadata fields (title, description, priority, assignee, tags, linked_files, effort). Omit any field to leave it unchanged.
- **`automatic_set_feature_state`**: Change a feature's lifecycle state. Valid states: `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `review`, `complete`, `cancelled`.
- **`automatic_archive_feature`**: Archive a feature — hides it from the Kanban board and from default list results. Preserves the feature's `state` for restoration.
- **`automatic_unarchive_feature`**: Restore an archived feature to active status in its original state column.
- **`automatic_delete_feature`**: Permanently delete a feature and all its updates. Cannot be undone — prefer archiving.
- **`automatic_add_feature_update`**: Append a markdown progress update to a feature. Pass `author` to identify the agent.

**Agent workflow for Features:**

1. At session start, call `automatic_list_features` with `state: "todo"` to see planned work. Archived features are excluded automatically.
2. Before starting a task, call `automatic_set_feature_state` to move it to `in_progress`.
3. During work, call `automatic_add_feature_update` to log significant progress, decisions, or blockers.
4. On completion, call `automatic_set_feature_state` to move to `review` — let the user verify before marking `complete`.
5. If new work is discovered during implementation, call `automatic_create_feature` to capture it in the backlog.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. **On session start** — call `automatic_list_skills` to see what skills are available. If a skill matches the current task domain, call `automatic_read_skill` to load it and view its companion resources. Optionally call `automatic_search_memories` to retrieve past learnings for the current project.

2. **For project context** — call `automatic_list_projects` to find the relevant project, then `automatic_read_project` to load its configuration and `automatic_get_project_context` to load its commands, concepts, conventions, and gotchas.

3. **For project setup** — call `automatic_list_mcp_servers` to see registered servers, then `automatic_sync_project` to apply the configuration.

4. **For skill discovery** — call `automatic_search_skills` to find community skills relevant to the task at hand.

5. **Wrapping up a session** — Call `automatic_store_memory` to capture any new project-specific conventions, pitfalls, or setup steps discovered so they aren't lost in future sessions.

6. **For project features** — call `automatic_list_features` to see planned work. Use `automatic_set_feature_state` and `automatic_add_feature_update` to track progress across sessions.

## Configuration

Automatic's MCP server is configured in the agent tool's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexus": {
      "command": "nexus",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `nexus` binary is the Automatic desktop app binary. When invoked with `mcp-serve`, it starts the MCP server on stdio and does not open any UI.
