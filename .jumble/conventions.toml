static_site = """
Velvet is a purely static single-page marketing site. All deployable artifacts live in the dist/ directory; treat dist/ as generated output only.
"""

web_components = """
All reusable UI patterns are implemented as Web Components in components.js. Update or add components there, then use them declaratively in index.html.
"""

tailwind_usage = """
Tailwind CSS classes are authored in src/input.css and compiled into dist/style.css. Do not edit dist/style.css directly; changes will be overwritten by the build.
"""

build_pipeline = """
Use npm run dev for local development and npm run build for static builds. The scripts in package.json orchestrate Tailwind, esbuild, file watching, and the live-server dev server.
"""

html_single_entry = """
index.html is the single entry point and contains all sections. There is no client-side routing; all navigation is via in-page anchors.
"""

[gotchas]
no_tests = """
There is currently no automated test suite configured. The npm test script is a placeholder that exits with an error.
"""

dist_is_generated = """
Never hand-edit files in dist/. They are regenerated on every build or dev run and should not be committed as source of truth.
"""

asset_paths = """
The build script rewrites asset paths when copying index.html into dist/. If you change script or stylesheet paths, ensure scripts/build.mjs remains consistent.
